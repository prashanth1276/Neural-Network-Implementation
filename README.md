# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch

A minimal implementation of a 3-layer neural network built purely with NumPy, demonstrating the fundamental mathematics of deep learning without high-level frameworks.

## Key Features
- ✅ Pure NumPy implementation (no TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- ✅ 3-layer architecture (Input-Hidden-Output)
- ✅ Manual implementation of forward/backward propagation
- ✅ Sigmoid activation function
- ✅ Gradient descent optimization
- ✅ Training over 5000 epochs

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prashanth1276/MiniTorch.git
cd MiniTorch
python neural_network.py
